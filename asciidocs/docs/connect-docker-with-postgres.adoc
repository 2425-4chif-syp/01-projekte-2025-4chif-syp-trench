This guide explains how to set up a PostgreSQL database and pgAdmin using Docker. It also demonstrates how to connect pgAdmin to the database step-by-step.

== Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed and ready:

- **Docker Desktop** (running in Linux container mode).
- **Docker Compose**.
- Basic familiarity with Docker commands.

== Step 1: Docker Compose Configuration
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    container_name: postgres_container
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    container_name: pgadmin_container
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: your_email@example.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: your_password
    ports:
      - "8080:80"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
----

This file defines two services:

1. `postgres`: Runs the PostgreSQL database.
2. `pgadmin`: Runs the pgAdmin web-based database management interface.

== Step 2: Start the Services
Run the following commands to start the containers:

[command]
----
$ docker-compose up -d
----

Once the containers are up, confirm that they’re running:

[command]
----
$ docker ps
----

This command will display a list of running containers. Ensure both `postgres_container` and `pgadmin_container` are listed.

== Step 3: Access the Services

=== Access pgAdmin
1. Open your web browser and go to:
   `http://localhost:8080`
2. Log in using the credentials defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file:
   - **Email**: `your_email@example.com`
   - **Password**: `your_password`

=== Connect pgAdmin to PostgreSQL
1. In pgAdmin, right-click on **Servers** and select **Create → Server**.
2. Fill in the details on the following tabs:

[.table-striped,.table-bordered,.table-hover]
|===
| **Tab** | **Field**            | **Value**
| General | Name                 | My PostgreSQL Server
| Connection | Host              | localhost or host.docker.internal
| Connection | Port              | 5432
| Connection | Maintenance DB    | postgres
| Connection | Username          | postgres
| Connection | Password          | your_password
|===

3. Click **Save**. pgAdmin will now connect to your PostgreSQL database.

== Common Issues and Troubleshooting

=== Docker Desktop is not running
Ensure Docker Desktop is fully started. Open it and wait until the status icon in the taskbar indicates it is running.

=== Linux Container Mode
If Docker Desktop is not in Linux Container mode:
- Right-click the Docker Desktop icon in the taskbar and select **Switch to Linux Containers**.

=== `version` is obsolete warning
If you see a warning about the `version` attribute being obsolete in `docker-compose.yml`, simply remove the `version` line.

=== Cannot connect to PostgreSQL
Check the following:
- Containers are running (`docker ps`).
- Credentials match the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- Use `localhost` or `host.docker.internal` for the host.

== Step 4: Manage Your Database
Once connected, you can:
- Use **pgAdmin** to create tables, run SQL queries, and manage your database visually.
- Use the PostgreSQL CLI (`psql`) for direct command-line interaction.

=== Connecting with `psql`
You can connect to your database from your terminal using:

[command]
----
$ psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres
----

- **-h**: Hostname (`localhost`).
- **-U**: Username (`postgres`).
- **-d**: Database name (`postgres`).

== Summary
Congratulations! You have successfully:
- Set up PostgreSQL and pgAdmin using Docker.
- Connected pgAdmin to your PostgreSQL database.

You can now manage your database using pgAdmin or `psql` as needed.
